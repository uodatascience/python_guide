    "Python is an interpreted programming language. An interpreted programming language is a \"high-level\" programming language that converts syntactically correct human-readable text into a series of tricks that are already in a language that a computer can understand. Interpreted languages contrast with compiled languages, which need to be converted (compiled) to computer language (machine code) before they can be used.\n",

    "Everything in Python is an object. \n",
    "\n",
    "Every object has an '''identity, a type, and a value'''. An object's '''identity''' is not the name given to it on assignment, but its literal identity to the computer -- roughly its memory address. An object's '''type''' determines, as we have seen above, the operations or `methods` available to it: Python knows how to add numbers because addition is defined for objects that are number types. An object's '''value''' is a more nebulous concept, but we can think of it as the data that the object contains ([in some places in the documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/reference/expressions.html#value-comparisons) value is implicitly defined as the thing that is used in comparison operations). \n",
    "\n",
    "Objects have '''attributes''' and '''methods.''' Attributes function mostly like [an object's dictionary](https://docs.python.org/2.7/reference/datamodel.html#the-standard-type-hierarchy), and are the object's (relatively) static properties. Methods are functions that are particular to a class (unbound) or particular to an instance (bound) ([for more clarification about an instance vs. a class](https://www.codecademy.com/en/forum_questions/558cd3fc76b8fe06280002ce) and [what it means to be bound vs unbound method](http://stupidpythonideas.blogspot.com/2013/06/how-methods-work.html)). Both are accessed using `.` notation, the difference being that methods are '''called''' using the `()` operator. Perhaps confusingly, anything using the `.` notation is considered an attribute -- one can think of an object having a method as one of its attributes in that having that method is something that describes the object, or something the object knows about, but methods have the special ability of running additional code when called with `()`."
